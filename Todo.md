# Fix

## Fullscreen

**When fullscreen is enabled, the window will not resize to the correct size.**

## Background Transparency

**When background transparency is enabled, it just doesn't work.**

## Text Size

**When text size is somewhere above 20, the text will not be rendered correctly, as it will be cut off. (Seems to be the font is changing size but not the text itself.)**

# Add

## IPC

**Add IPC support.**
